{"name":"Warehouse","tagline":"Warehouse Project in Play","body":"## Welcome to Warehouse Project!\r\nThe Warehouse application creates a data model for a simple Warehouse management system.  A Warehouse is located at a single address and can hold many stock items at its location. A single stock item can identify itself with only one type of product however a Warehouse can have multiple stock items of a certain product.  Then each product type can be marked by multiple tags.   \r\n  \r\nWe have implemented this simple Warehouse data model in a Play application and more about the data model can be seen by the entity relationships below.\r\n\r\n## About Warehouse Data Model\r\n\r\n![Warehouse](https://raw.github.com/kcanida/Warehouse/master/images/Warehouse%20Data%20Model.png)\r\n\r\n## About the Project\r\nFor more details on this project see:\r\n* [User Guide](https://github.com/kcanida/Warehouse/wiki/User-Guide)\r\n* [Developer Guide](https://github.com/kcanida/Warehouse/wiki/Developer-Guide)\r\n* [Contact Us](https://github.com/kcanida/Warehouse/wiki/Contact-Us)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
